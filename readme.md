ImageShop
=========

A cross-platform variant of PhotoShop written in Qt creator, using both Serial and Parallel implementations for editing algorithms.  

This application was written for my SOFT339 (CUDA) and SOFT336 (Cross Platform Software Development) courses at Plymouth University.  The application demonstrates how image processing software can benefit from utilising parallel programming techniques to enhance performance of CPU intensive tasks, such as applying a filter to an image file which exceeds 20MB in size.

The application boasts a limited set of tools, such as Black and White filters, RGB, Brightness & Contrast, Hue/Saturation, Cropping and Moving.

In future I hope to add a layer system, but presently I don't have the time to overcomplicate the application to that extent.

Please feel free to fork and use this code for your own personal learning, do not submit it as your own though.
